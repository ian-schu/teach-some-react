This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Objectives

1) Intro to ES6 / build comfort with modern JS
2) Broad understanding of asset pipeline - transpilation, minify, bundle, etc.
3) Basic React component concepts
4) Passing props down the component tree
5) Defining class methods, updating state

Other stuff we'll need along the way ...
* React dev tools
* Chrome debugger (breakpoints especially)
* Watch out for `this` binding in methods

## Resources:

We're building a real classic today: the Todo List!
